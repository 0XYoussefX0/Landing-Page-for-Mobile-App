        "Allah Humma Barik this app is exceptional if you want to get into a habit of reading the quran be it may even if its just a verse a day. I do dua for you that Allah swt grants you jannat ul firdos for everyone who has taken part to make this app possible Ameen. I have a suggestion, if you could have the ability to speed the recitation voice up or slow it down (like Quran central) keep up your good work",
